This is the R Script corresponding to the Paper "Spatiotemporal patterns of cyclist collisions in Germany:  variations in frequency, severity, and type of collisions in 2019". In the first section the functions for downloading and processing collision data from the collision dataset of the German Federal Statistical Office will be presented and explained step by step. The sections that follow represent the workflow for all statistics and graphs that are included in the paper. 

Note: The library [collisionsDE](https://github.com/lutzhutz/collisionsDE) is a self written library by the leading author and a work in progress.
