This is the R Skript corresponding to the Bachelor Thesis "Analysis of Collisions with Cyclist Participation by Regional Typology in Germany" by the author Lasse Harkort. In the first section the functions for downloading and processing collision data from the collision dataset of the German Federal Statistical Office will be presented and explained step by step. The sections that follow represent the workflow for all statistics and graphs that are included in the thesis.To run the full script at once **you will need the folder with some additional data** starting from the section *"Nearest road maximum speed limit"* as some of the steps have been made in the software QGIS.
